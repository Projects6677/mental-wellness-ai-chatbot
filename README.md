🤖 MindMate: Your AI-Powered Wellness Companion
🧠 Project Overview
MindMate is a self-contained, offline-first web application designed to be a private and empathetic AI companion for mental wellness. Built as a single HTML file, it runs directly in the browser, offering a seamless and confidential experience without the need for a server. It provides a non-judgmental space for users to track their emotional journey, find immediate support, and practice mindfulness.

✨ Core Features
Intelligent AI Assistant 💬
The core of MindMate is a compassionate AI chatbot that listens, validates feelings, and offers personalized coping strategies. It uses context from your conversation to provide a more meaningful and empathetic response.

Dynamic Mood Check-ins 🎨
Visually track your emotional state over time with a daily check-in calendar and a mood progression chart. The app's background dynamically changes to reflect your current mood, creating a personalized and immersive experience.

Private & Secure Journaling 🔐
Your thoughts are kept completely private. The journaling vault is secured with a user-set PIN and all data is stored locally on your device, ensuring your entries remain confidential.

Adaptive Persona 🧠
The AI seamlessly switches its persona from a "Calm Listener" to a "Motivational Coach" or "Gentle Friend" based on your mood, making conversations feel more natural and responsive to your needs.

Gamified Motivation 🎮
Stay on track with daily quests and streak challenges. Earn unique badges for milestones like a 7-day streak or completing the wellness challenge, adding a fun, motivating element to your journey.

Quick Coping Tools 🫁
Instantly access guided breathing exercises with a visual animation, and listen to mood-specific YouTube playlists embedded directly in the app.

Personalized Crisis Plan 🆘
In moments of severe distress, the app provides a pre-written, user-defined SOS plan along with a list of crisis helplines, ensuring you have immediate and personalized support.
